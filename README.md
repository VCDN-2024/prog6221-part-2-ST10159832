Prog Poe part 2 
Recipe app 
The recipe app is designed and developed to provide users with software that will allow them to enter as many recipes as they wish too as well as enter the type of ingredients the recipe will require, the quantity, food group and calories of the ingredients. 

visual studio 2022 is the IDE that is used to develop the recipe app,  this software must be downloaded from google, chrome or any other trusted internet browser. To download the software, you will need to open up an internet browser of yor choice, in the search bar, type ‘visual studio 2022 download’, upon searching you will see the results and in specific you are looking for ‘visual studio 2022 IDE – Programming tool software’ that is provided by Microsoft. Clicking on that will direct you to the Microsoft page that will allow you to download the software, you will see a drop down menu with ‘download visual studio’ on it, click the drop down menu and choose ‘community 2022’. Upon selection you will notice in the top right corner something is downloading, this is the visual studio software set up, if you do not see this go to your download and it should be the download at the top, selecting this will bring up a pop that asks for permission to set up the software and if you trust the software, you will have agree and trust the download before setting up the software, you will then see a pop up saying visual studio installer, clicking on agree allows you to install the software on your laptop or desktop. Upon completion of the installation, you will need to choose your workloads that you want on visual studio, I have selected .netframe as it is what I need to build the project. After choosing the workload you may choose individual components, language packs and installation location. Once completed you have successfully set up visual studio code 2022 and can now create you first project. You will be presented with the start window in which you select create new project, you will be directed to a page that requires you to select your preferred template, I have selected console app and C# and my template and language, thereafter you can select the version of .net that you want to use, I have selected .net 8.0, once done you are finally required to name your project and then you are able to code your project. 
In the program.cs page which is your main page you can code directly onto there or create other internal classes and enter your code there and just call it in the main page(program.cs), in my project I created many different internal classes and called these classes in other classes if I had to by, for example I used  ‘ClassOne classone = new ClassOne’ to call ClassOne in ClassTwo, you could do this wherever you need to and this basically makes your code more neater and understandable to other coders, this falls under good coding practises. The use of methods is to create different types of functionality in your project without getting confused and makes code easier to work with and understand, method names are usually very descriptive and tell you what the method does, you can call these methods in the main page of the project or in any other page that you created, I have a method class called ‘CalculateTotalCalories’ and this method basically calculates the total calories in a recipe and can display if the user wants to. Error handling basically notifies the user that there is a problem with the input and tells them what type of input Is expected, there is error handling throughout my code as it is also good coding practises. The unit test are implemented to ensure that the methods created function as they are suppose to and unit testing is a good way for developers to test their code. To execute code or the program users can select the green play button that is placed at the top of the screen in the middle, next to the green play button will have the name  of the project and scrolling over the name will give you a message saying  ‘run’, this allows user to run the app and allows developers to ensure the app works before publishing it.
